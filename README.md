### About me
 A full-stack junior developer and lifelong problem solver. I discovered coding after a career self-employed as a domestic and commercial mechanical engineer including leading teams to redesign building heating and plumbing infrastructure. As a linguist, I have also traveled Europe learning to work and communicate in every country I stayed in. Iâ€™m excited to channel my love of learning into tech. Since my teens years I have been part of a group of friends with interest and careers in the IT industry, always been intrigued and curious about their discussions and enthusiasm. I developed a passion for problem-solving which eventually lead me to Makers. Here, my tech knowledge massively expanded and allowed me to set the foundation for the successful coding career that I always dreamt of.
  
### Projects
*  [Woke App](https://github.com/mondongos/woke-platypus) - part of the team PLatypus Boys Woke app is an Android application developed in Java and Android Studio that implements Text to Speech and Speech to Text. The idea of the project is to create a quiz app that can be used hands free while driving and to be used only with voice commands. For Text to Speech implementation my team and I took advantage of the in-build Android Studio TTS For Speech to Text functionality we included DialogueFlow with the help of API. The project has been done using Java and JUnit as testing framework.

*  [Makers-BnB](https://github.com/Cosmin-Croitoriu/Makers-Bnb) - part of Team Alpha Makers-Bnb is a web application in which various users create an account, can view a list of available properties for renting, list their properties for a specific period of time, as well as accept or reject requests from other users. Developed in Ruby and Sinatra, including Postgresql for database, DataMapper as ORM, Rspec and Capybara as testing frameworks, HTML and CSS for frontend. The server has been remotely hosted on Heroku.

*  [Acebook](https://github.com/marbuthnott/acebook-d-railed) - part of team D-railed Acebook Web app allows users to sign up and sign in, submit posts on their Wall Page or on other users; like or dislike various posts; delete or update the posts they created in . Group project as a Facebook clone, developed in Ruby on Rails, with the help of Activerecord, HTML, CSS, Travis CI, RSpec, Capybara

*  [Takeaway Challenge](https://github.com/Cosmin-Croitoriu/takeaway-challenge) - solo project, This is a Makers kata in which I used, for the first time, an API to enable a text message receiving app, Environmental Variables for encoding sensitive data, developed in Ruby using TDD (Rspec). I have used Agile Process, Dependency Injection, Single Responsibility Principle, Separation of Concerns, Mocks and Stubs. The aim of this project is to build a takeaway program to meet the user requirements. The program enables the user to view a list of dishes with prices and select some dishes they want to order. There is build_in verification within the program to check that the total cost/bill of the order matches what is expected given what the user has ordered. The user will confirm that they want to place the order. Once the order is placed, the user will receive a text message that their order will be delivered before the order time (+1hr).

*  [Bank_tech_kata](https://github.com/Cosmin-Croitoriu/bank_tech_kata) - solo project, Aim - testing OO and TDD skills by creating code that is easy to access and interact via IRB. The project is meant to mimic a tech test, using best practices, built with Ruby and Rspec.

### Skills

#### Self-Management
 I have worked as a self-employed as an HVAC engineer, taking part in various projects and contracts. I have always managed to self-organise, take initiative, contribute and complete contracts at the highest standards.
#### Leadership and Teamwork
 Throughout my mechanical engineering journey I have amassed extensive experience and management qualifications (SSSTS, Level 3 First Aider, Fire Marshal, Sentinel, PASMA) and was in charge of teams on various projects, my most important being the HVAC redesign of an embassy (2 Stratford Place) on behalf of LUL, planning works, reviewing designs, managing a team of 5 engineers and directly liaising with various institutions(Thames Water, Crossrail, HSE) during the whole project. 
#### Problem Solving
 During my 3 years working in the WowBeez gaming hub, and also through my mechanical engineering career a high degree of problem solving was involved. 80% of my work experience from the latter industry is due to fixing problems, designing, adapting various trade services to continuously updating construction standards and regulations.
