## Skills

#### Fast learner
Makers helped me discover a new power - quick learning abilities - learn new concepts and apply them to a range of different problems that serve various purposes.

#### Adaptable
I am not afraid to try new things, experiement and learn from experiences to improve. As a bank staff for NHS I used to work different roles all the time and I enjoyed being part of different teams and learn how they work and how they connect to other services.

#### Teamwork
I love being part of a team, share my ideas and learn from others.
